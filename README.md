This is a Calculator I built as part of The Odin Project.  It is currently fully functional.
I would like to add:
    an attractive interface;
    functionality for hitting '=' multiple times in a row (ie 1+2=3=5=6);
    functionality for hitting an operator and then '=' (ie 2 += would display 4);
    add floating point '.' support (only one '.' and needs to round it to certain length);
    add a backspace button;
    add keyboard support3.
